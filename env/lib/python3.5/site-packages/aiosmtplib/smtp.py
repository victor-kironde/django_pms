        This command performs an entire mail transaction.

        The arguments are:
            - sender: The address sending this mail.
            - recipients: A list of addresses to send this mail to.  A bare
                string will be treated as a list with 1 address.
            - message: The message string to send.
            - mail_options: List of options (such as ESMTP 8bitmime) for the
                MAIL command.
            - rcpt_options: List of options (such as DSN commands) for all the
                RCPT commands.

        message must be a string containing characters in the ASCII range.
        The string is encoded to bytes using the ascii codec, and lone \\\\r
        and \\\\n characters are converted to \\\\r\\\\n characters.

        If there has been no previous HELO or EHLO command this session, this
        method tries EHLO first.

        This method will return normally if the mail is accepted for at least
        one recipient.  It returns a tuple consisting of:

            - an error dictionary, with one entry for each recipient that was
                refused.  Each entry contains a tuple of the SMTP error code
                and the accompanying error message sent by the server.
            - the message sent by the server in response to the DATA command
                (often containing a message id)

        Example:

             >>> loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
             >>> smtp = aiosmtplib.SMTP(hostname='localhost', port=10025)
             >>> loop.run_until_complete(smtp.connect())
             (220, ...)
             >>> recipients = ['one@one.org', 'two@two.org', '3@three.org']
             >>> message = "From: Me@my.org\\nSubject: testing\\nHello World"
             >>> send_coro = smtp.sendmail('me@my.org', recipients, message)
             >>> loop.run_until_complete(send_coro)
             ({}, 'OK')
             >>> loop.run_until_complete(smtp.quit())
             (221, Bye)

        In the above example, the message was accepted for delivery for all
        three addresses. If delivery had been only successful to two
        of the three addresses, and one was rejected, the response would look
        something like::

             (
                 {
                    'nobody@three.org': (550 ,'User unknown'),
                 },
                 'Written safely to disk. #902487694.289148.12219.',
             )

        If delivery is not successful to any addresses,
        :exc:`SMTPRecipientsRefused` is raised.

        If :exc:`SMTPResponseException` is raised by this method, we try to
        send an RSET command to reset the server envelope automatically for
        the next attempt.
